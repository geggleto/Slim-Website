# Removal of Stop/Halt
Slim Core has removed Stop/Halt. 
In your applications, you should transition to using the withStatusCode() and withBody()

Example In Slim 2.x:
{% highlight php %}
$app->get(‘/’, function () {  $app->halt(400, ‘Bad Request’); });
{% endhighlight %}
And now in Slim 3.x:

{% highlight php %}
$app->get(‘/’, function ($req, $res, $args) { return $res->withStatus(400)->withBody(“Bad Request”); });
{% endhighlight %}

# Hooks
Slim v3 no longer has the concept of hooks. Hooks were removed as they duplicate the functionality already present in middlewares. You should be able to easily convert your Hook code into Middleware code.

# Removal HTTP Cache
Slim v3 no longer ships with HTTP Cache methods in core. It has been moved to its own separate repo (https://github.com/slimphp/Slim-HttpCache )

# Changed Redirect
In Slim v2.x one would use the helper function $app->redirect(); to trigger a redirect request.
In Slim v3.x one can do the same with using the Response class like so.

Example:
{% highlight php %}
$app->get(‘/’, function ($req, $res, $args) {
    return $res->withStatus(301)->withHeader(“Location”, “yournewuri”);
});
{% endhighlight %}

# Middleware
Signature
----
The middleware signature has changed from a class to a function
New signature: {% highlight php %}php $app->add(function ($req, $res, $next) {}); {% endhighlight %}

Execution
-----
Application middleware is executed as Last In First Executed (LIFE)

# Flash Messages
In v3.0 the concept of flash messages has been removed. There currently is no planned feature for this, but could likely be a part of the Cookies package

# Cookies
In v3.0 cookies has been removed from core and moved to a separate component  See (https://github.com/slimphp/Slim-Http-Cookies)

# Removal of Crypto
In v3.0 we have removed the dependency for crypto in core

# PHP Version
Slim v3.0 requires php 5.4+

# Route Callbacks
In v3.0 we have adopted a new callback signature
{% highlight php %}
$app->get('/', function (\Psr\Http\Message\ServerRequestInterface $request,
\Psr\Http\Message\ResponseInterface $response, $args) {
//do stuff!
});
{% endhighlight %}

# New Router
Slim now utilizes a new more powerful router ( https://github.com/nikic/FastRoute )!

# Route Middleware
The syntax for adding route middleware has changed slightly.
In v3.0:
{% highlight php %}php $app->get(…)->add($mw2)->add($mw1); {% endhighlight %}
